 <h1>Rules</h1>

  <p>
    There is one important rule when using uiloos:
    <strong>you may never directly manipulate any of the fields of the components!</strong>
    Otherwise the subscribers will not be informed, and changes to the "live"
    properties will not be detected.
  </p>

  <p>
    So always use the appropriate methods to realize the changes you want to see,
    so the components can keep the observers / subscribers in the loop.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another rule is that you should not be using anything inside of the components
    that start with an underscore. These classes / methods / instance
    fields should be considered private. 
    <strong>
      We reserve the right to change their names / inner workings and not
      consider it a breaking change! So please do not use and depend on them.
    </strong>
