    <h2 id="introduction" ><a href="#introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>
      In this tutorial we are going to progressively enhance a CSS snap 
      based carousel.
    </p>

    <p>
      In modern CSS it is possible to create "snap" scroll experiences using the
      <a 
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type" 
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" 
        target="_blank"
        class="underline">scroll-snap-type
      </a> property. This allows you to create a scrollable area, which when 
      the user scrolls though it, makes the content snaps to an axis. This means 
      that when the user stops scrolling, the browser will make the scrollable area
      always stop at a snap point, and never halfway.
    </p>

    <p>
      With CSS snap points you can create a carousel that does not require any JavaScript
      to work. Lets see how we can use the <a class="high underline" href="/api/core/activelist">ActiveList</a>
      to enhance the experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get started with the tutorial open and fork this 
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/activelist-snap-carousel-tutorial-qr7st5?file=/index.html" class="underline text-purple-600">sandbox</a>.
      By using the sandbox you do not have to worry to much about setting
      up an entire development environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="files-overview" ><a href="#files-overview">2. Files overview</a></h2>

    <p>
      In the sandbox you will see a couple of files:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-disc m-2 mb-4">
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        <span class="high">carousel.css</span> it contains all CSS needed for the carousel.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        <span class="high">index.html</span> contains the HTML for the CSS snap carousel. It also
        includes "uiloos" from the UNPKG cdn.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8">
        <span class="high">carousel.js</span> in this empty file we are going to bring
        the carousel to life.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="goals" ><a href="#goals">3. Goals</a></h2>

    <p>
      We want our carousel to do the following things:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal m-2 mb-4">
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        It should auto play and move through the slides automatically.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        When the user interacts with the carousel the auto play should stop.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        Show a progress indicator so the user an see when the next slide is going to appear.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8">
        Visually provide a "tell" that the carousel can be swiped through. 
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="setting-up-autoplay" ><a href="#setting-up-autoplay">4. Setting up autoPlay</a></h2>

    <p>
      First play around a little with the carousel at its current state. See that without 
      any JavaScript it just works through the magic off CSS snap.
    </p>

    <p> 
      In the "index.html" file note that the "carousel" is a <span class="high">ul</span> HTML element, 
      where each <span class="high">li</span> is a slide. What we are going to 
      do is scroll to each slide, when it is active.
    </p>

    <p>Open up the "carousel.js" file and add the following: </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
// I chose to represent each slide as a number.
const slides = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];

const config = {
  contents: slides,

  activeIndexes: [0],

  autoPlay: {
    // Each slide should take 2000 milliseconds, note
    // that you can also provide a function so each
    // slide has a unique duration.
    duration: 5000
  }
};

const carousel = new window.uiloosActiveList.ActiveList(
  config,
  (carousel, event) => {
    if (event.type === "ACTIVATED") {
      // Get the new visible slide
      const slideEl = document.getElementById(`carousel-slide-${event.index}`);

      // and scroll it into view smoothly
      slideEl.scrollIntoView({
        behavior: "smooth"
      });
    }
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      This creates a carousel which slides automatically from the first slide 
      over to the last slide.
    </p>

    <p>
      What the code does is initialize an <a href="/api/core/activelist/" class="underline high">ActiveList</a> which 
      has five contents, each a number representing each slide. By setting <a href="/api/core/activelistconfig/#autoplay" class="underline high">autoPlay</a> up
      with a duration of 5000, each 5 seconds a new slide will be scrolled to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever a slide becomes activated, our subscriber (the second argument to the ActiveList) is called with an  <a href="/api/core/activelistactivatedevent" class="underline high">ACTIVATED</a> event.
      It is there that we query the slides <span class="high">li</span> element and scroll it in view.
    </p>

    <p>
      By scrolling with <span class="high">behavior</span> set to <span class="high">smooth</span> the 
      browser will animate the scrolling.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="making-it-circular" ><a href="#making-it-circular">5. Making it circular</a></h2>

    <p>
      Our animation stops whenever it is at the final slide. Perhaps it is better if it would 
      then repeats the carousel at the first slide, lets try and make this happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the "carousel.js" alter the "config" and set <a href="/api/core/activelistconfig/#iscircular" class="underline high">isCircular</a> to
      <span class="high">true</span>:
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
const config = {
  // Abbreviated for brevity, rest of 
  // config is still the same.

  // Make the last slide go to the first slice and vice versa
  isCircular: true
};
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      Now what you should see happening is that after the final slide it goes back to the 
      first slide. It will repeat this cycle forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      It however feels a little of putting, the animation from last- to first slide takes a lot of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we could give it the illusion of being infinity scrollable? What that means is that 
      when it is at the last slide, it should scroll "right" back to the first slide. This way 
      the carousel always moves to the right, and never runs out of slides.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for this to work we need to perform a magic trick: we need to take the previous
      active slide and move it to the back, so it becomes the last slide.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the "carousel.js" alter the "config" and set <a href="/api/core/activelistconfig/#maxactivationlimit" class="underline high">maxActivationLimit</a> to
      <span class="high">2</span>:
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
const config = {
  // Abbreviated for brevity, rest of 
  // config is still the same.

  // Allow two slides to be 'active' at the same time, the
  // previous slide, and the current active slide.
  // This is done se we can 'move' the last shown slide
  // to the last position.
  maxActivationLimit: 2
};
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      The trick is explained in the comments: what we do is allow two
      "slides" to be active at the same time. <b>Nothing states that whatever
      the ActiveList considers active must actually be shown on the screen.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      This can be a bit of a mind-bender even for me the author of the 
      library. 
    </p>

    <p>
      What this does is make the <a href="/api/core/activelist#active" class="underline high">active</a> array
      contain a maximum of two elements. The first element is the previous active slide, and 
      the second element the current active slide.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      You might think, what happens if three contents become active? The answer is 
      that this is decided by the configured <a href="/api/core/activelistconfig/#maxactivationlimitbehavior" class="underline high">maxActivationLimitBehavior</a>.
      By default it is set to <span class="high">circular</span> meaning it will drop the first 
      content that was active to make space for the newly activated content.
    </p>

     <p>
      Now to make this work alter the "carousel.js" file keep the 
      "config" but alter the rest of the code to: 
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
// Get a reference to the carousel element
const carouselEl = document.getElementById("carousel");

const carousel = new window.uiloosActiveList.ActiveList(
  config,
  (carousel, event) => {
    if (event.type === "ACTIVATED") {
      // Get the new visible slide
      const slideEl = document.getElementById(`carousel-slide-${event.index}`);

      // and scroll it into view smoothly
      slideEl.scrollIntoView({
        behavior: "smooth"
      });

      // Now this is the magic trick: we take the previous
      // slide and move it to the last position. This creates
      // an infinitely scrolling snap carousel.
      const lastActivated = carousel.active[0];

      const lastActiveSlideEl = document.getElementById(
        `carousel-slide-${lastActivated}`
      );

      // Do perform the move after a timeout however, so the move
      // does not affect the smooth scroll of the next slide.
      window.setTimeout(() => {
        // First remove the slide from the DOM.
        lastActiveSlideEl.remove();

        // And append the last slide at the end of the carousel.
        carouselEl.append(lastActiveSlideEl);

        // Reset the scrollLeft, needed for Safari
        // and FireFox otherwise the wrong slide
        // will be shown.
        carouselEl.scrollLeft = 0;
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      Take a look at your carousel and note that it is now circular!
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="stopping-on-interaction" ><a href="#a-progress-indicator">6. Stopping on interaction</a></h2>

    <p>
      We have now enhanced the carousel with a pretty nifty auto play, but we 
      have broken the user interaction, it is now unusable because the auto play
      interferes with user interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lets stop the auto play as soon as the user mouses over the carousel, 
      and continue playing if the user mouses out of the carousel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Add the following code at the bottom of 'carousel.js':
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
// Top of file is abbreviated for brevity.

// Unfortunately there is no way of knowing whether or
// not a scroll happend programmatically via "scrollIntoView"
// or by the end user.
let carouselIsScrolling = false;

const carousel = new window.uiloosActiveList.ActiveList(
  config,
  (carousel, event) => {
    if (event.type === "ACTIVATED") {
      // Get the new visible slide
      const slideEl = document.getElementById(`carousel-slide-${event.index}`);

      // We are now scrolling as the carousel.
      carouselIsScrolling = true;

      slideEl.scrollIntoView({
        behavior: "smooth",
        inline: "start"
      });

      // Abbreviated for brevity, rest of ACTIVATED is still the same.
    }
  }
);

// Disable the carousel when users mouse enters the carousel
carouselEl.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => {
  carousel.pause();
});

// Enable the carousel again when users mouse exits the carousel.
carouselEl.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
  if (!carousel.autoPlay.hasBeenStoppedBefore) {
    carousel.play();
  }
});

// When the user scrolls stop the autoplay, the user now takes over.
carouselEl.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
  // In browser that do not support "onscrollend"
  // stop the carousel when not playing. This does
  // lead to a funky behavior: when the carousel
  // is scrolling and the user hovers over the
  // carousel at that moment, the carousel will
  // stop.
  if (!("onscrollend" in window) && !carousel.autoPlay.isPlaying) {
    carousel.stop();
    return;
  }

  // If the carousel is scrolling automatically no not stop.
  if (carouselIsScrolling) {
    return;
  }

  // The scroll event is also triggered by the ACTIVATED scrollIntoView
  // and we want to ignore that. We know when the user hovers over the
  // carousel that is is "paused", so if it is playing at this moment
  // we know it is an carousel ACTIVATED scroll
  if (!carousel.autoPlay.isPlaying) {
    carousel.stop();
  }
});

// This is called multiple times for some reason,
// when scrolling via "scrollIntoView" so it must be debounced.
let scrollEndTimerId = -1;
carouselEl.addEventListener("scrollend", () => {
  window.clearTimeout(scrollEndTimerId);

  scrollEndTimerId = window.setTimeout(() => {
    // The carousel auto scroll has come to an end.
    carouselIsScrolling = false;
  }, 500);
});

{% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      The most tricky bit understanding why we do not call <a href="/api/core/activelist/#play" class="underline high">play()</a> when
      <a href="/api/core/activelistautoplay/#hasbeenstoppedbefore" class="underline high">hasBeenStoppedBefore</a> is <span class="high">false</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason for this is a conflict between the "scroll means stop", and "mouse out should continue" logic. You only want 
      to continue the animation on mouse out if the user did not scroll the carousel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="/api/core/activelistautoplay/#hasbeenstoppedbefore" class="underline high">hasBeenStoppedBefore</a> was created 
      for this precise scenario. It keeps track whether or not the auto play was stopped at one point in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another thing is that we only want to stop when the user scrolls, and not when the carousel is auto play scrolling.
      Unfortunately for us <span class="high">scrollIntoView</span> does not indicate in the event, 
      that it was called programmatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is why the <span class="high">carouselIsScrolling</span> and the <span class="high">scrollend</span> event
      must exist, so we can tell if it was the user or the carousel, which is unfortunate since this bloats up the code by quite a bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The carousel now pauses on hover and stops on user scroll.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="a-progress-indicator" ><a href="#a-progress-indicator">7. A progress indicator</a></h2>

    <p>
      It would be nice to give the user an indication of when the carousel will move 
      to the next slide. Lets add a progress indicator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again in the file "carousel.js" change the following:
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
// Top of file is abbreviated for brevity.

// Get a reference to the progress element
const progressEl = document.getElementById("carousel-progress");

const carousel = new window.uiloosActiveList.ActiveList(
  config,
  (carousel, event) => {
    // Start the progress animation
    if (event.type === "INITIALIZED") {
      progressEl.style.animation = `progress ${carousel.autoPlay.duration}ms linear`;
    }

    // Halt the animation when paused
    if (event.type === "AUTO_PLAY_PAUSED") {
      progressEl.style.animationPlayState = "paused";
    }

    // and resume when playing
    if (event.type === "AUTO_PLAY_PLAYING") {
      progressEl.style.animationPlayState = "running";
    }

    // Remove the progress indicator now that the user has
    // assumed full control over the carousel.
    if (event.type === "AUTO_PLAY_STOPPED") {
      progressEl.style.background = "white";
    }

    if (event.type === "ACTIVATED") {
      // Abbreviated for brevity, rest of ACTIVATED is still the same.

      // Technically the animation needs not be reset,
      // since all slides have the same duration. But
      // if you'd change the autoPlay duration to a
      // function the progress would be wrong.
      progressEl.style.animation = `progress ${carousel.autoPlay.duration}ms linear`;

      // By removing the node and inserting it again
      // the animation is restarted.
      progressEl.remove();
      carouselEl.parentElement.insertBefore(progressEl, carouselEl);
    }
  }
);
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      As you can see the code adds new events which result in new types for the 
      "subscriber" to handle. These chunks of code are relatively straightforward.
    </p>

    <p>
      The one bit that requires some explanation is the <span class="high">style.animationPlayState</span> it is 
      a property that allows you to pause and resume a CSS animation from within JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we have an accurate progress indicator the experience is really coming together.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="peak-ahead" ><a href="#peak-ahead">8. Peek ahead</a></h2>

    <p>
      At this point we have created a very nice carousel, but lets say our designer / product owner 
      throws us an extra requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>I want the user to always see part of the previous and next slides.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Lets call this carousel a peek ahead carousel.
    </p>

    <p>
      It requires some changes to the CSS so open up 'carousel.css' and 
      alter the <span class="high">.slide</span> to:
    </p>

{% highlight "css" %}
.slide {
  min-width: calc(512px - 48px);
  scroll-snap-align: center;
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      It does work but there are a two of things we need to fix:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal m-2 mb-4">
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        It would be nice if the carousel started on the second slide, 
        so the first slide is on its left. This is more visually consistent.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        Our move previous slide to last now breaks the carousel. It 
        causes a weird bump because suddenly there is nothing to the 
        left anymore, which is now visible. We should not move 
        the previous slide but the slide before the previous slide!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Lets make the changes first and then look at the why.
    </p>

    <p>
      In "carousel.js" change the config to:
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
const config = {
  // Only change activeIndexes, and maxActivationLimit

  // Start at the second slide so there is content
  // on both the left and the right, if started on the
  // 0 index, we would show a slide without a previous
  // slide, which looks sloppy.
  activeIndexes: [0, 1],

  // The last activated slide is the one we are going to show.
  // The slide that was active two slides ago we are going to
  // move. The trick here is that while the ActiveList considers
  // three slides to be active, we only consider the last active
  // slide active.
  maxActivationLimit: 3,
};
{% endhighlight %}

     <p>
      By increasing the <a href="/api/core/activelistconfig/#maxactivationlimit" class="underline high">maxActivationLimit</a> to
      <span class="high">3</span> we now have access to the previous slides, previous slide. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Now to make the scroll to the second slide at initialization alter the "INITIALIZED" event:
    </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
if (event.type === "INITIALIZED") {
  // Start the progress animation
  progressEl.style.animation = `progress ${carousel.autoPlay.duration}ms linear`;

  // Since we show the "second" slide initially have to
  // scroll to that slide on initialization.
  const slideEl = document.getElementById(
    `carousel-slide-${carousel.lastActivated}`
  );

  // Scroll instantly
  slideEl.scrollIntoView();
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    Finally in the "ACTIVATED" event change the "magic trick" to:
  </p>

{% highlight "javascript" %}
// Now this is the magic trick: we take the previous
// slide and move it to the last position. This creates
// an infinitely scrolling snap carousel.
// But because we show a litte of the the previous
// and next slides, (peek ahead) we need actually need to move
// the slide that was shown two iterations ago.
const previousPreviousSlide = carousel.active[0];

// Now take that element and move it.
const slideToBeMovedEl = document.getElementById(
  `carousel-slide-${previousPreviousSlide}`
);

// Do perform the move after a timeout however, so the move
// does not affect the smooth scroll of the next slide.
window.setTimeout(() => {
  // First remove the slide from the DOM.
  slideToBeMovedEl.remove();

  // And append the last slide at the end of the carousel.
  carouselEl.append(slideToBeMovedEl);

  // Reset the scrollLeft, needed for Safari
  // and FireFox otherwise the wrong slide
  // will be shown.
  carouselEl.scrollLeft = 512;
}, 1000);
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
      Our work has been done, we have a nice carousel that supports peak ahead.
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal m-2 mb-4">
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        That the <span class="high">subscriber</span> receives all events 
        that take place on the ActiveList, and that in the subscriber you
        must sync the DOM with what occurred.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        That via <span class="high">autoPlay</span> we can move through
        the slides programmatically at an interval.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        We can make an ActiveList not have an end and a beginning 
        by setting the <span class="high">isCircular</span> to 
        <span class="high">true</span>.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        That what is active inside of an ActiveList does not necessarily 
        have to be displayed on the screen.
      </li>
       <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        That via <span class="high">maxActivationLimit</span> we can 
        set the amount of items / content which can be active at a time.

        Browse through the API for the <a href="/api/core/activelist/" class="underline high">ActiveList</a>,
        see everything at your disposal.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        Read the API for the <a href="/api/core/activelistcontent/" class="underline high">ActiveListContent</a>.
        As it often provides the most convenient API for mutating the ActiveList.
      </li>
      <li class="ml-8 mb-4">
        Take a look and contrast the approach here with the 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/snap-carousel-react-peek-ahead-kt9sd3" class="underline text-purple-600">React version</a> 
        of the carousel. Which does not have a subscriber callback, 
        because React handles the DOM manipulation.
