        Dear Manager,
      </p>

      <p>
        You are probably reading this letter because one of your team members want to use this library
        and needs a license. Now you are wondering what this software library is all about.
      </p>

      <p>
       "uiloos" is a library which provides common user interface components, such as tabs, carousels 
        and more. Without having a visual appearance of its own, this gives designers the power to
        bring their own unique designs without compromising on the look and feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        An apt analogy is the Volkswagen group, a large automobile concern. It contains brands such 
        as Audi, SEAT and Å koda. It would be wasteful if each brand would create their own cars 
        completely from scratch, so what they did was create a "platform". The platform contains
        common components such as the chassis and suspensions. Each brand build on top of these
        platforms to create a unique design.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          What uiloos is a "platform" for user interface components, which provides common behaviors
          out of the box. uiloos will accelerate your front-end developers and lets them create 
          user interface components faster.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope to save your developers a lot of time and effort by providing them this library. 
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8">
        Yours truly,
      </p>

      <p>
