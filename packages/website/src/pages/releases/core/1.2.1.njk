  <!-- Title -->
  <h1>@uiloos/core 1.2.1</h1>

  <p>Released on <span class="font-mono">2023-06-27</span></p>

  <p>
    This releases fixes a bug in the <a href="/api/core/ActiveList/" class="underline high">ActiveList</a> in 
    the <a href="/api/core/activelist/#autoplay" class="underline high">autoPlay</a> behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the autoPlay is paused and then resumed again the duration should 
    takes into account the time that has already passed, before activating
    the next content. The duration was correctly calculated for the next content,
    but interfered with future contents. This was the result of a "pauseStarted" 
    variable not being reset.
  </p>

  <p>
    In other words pauses from the past would affect future autoPlays.
  </p>

  <p>
     The effect was that subsequent durations would get shorter and shorter.
     Also it could lead to a negative duration causing a 
     <a href="/api/core/ActiveListAutoPlayDurationError/" class="underline high">ActiveListAutoPlayDurationError</a>.
